<h1>Tesla</h1>
<p>Tesla, Inc. (originally Tesla Motors) was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding.[91]

Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Elon Musk's involvement.[92] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004, joining Tesla's board of directors as its chairman.[93] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed level, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[94]

Following the financial crisis in 2008 and after a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[72][95] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect, positions he still holds today. Tesla Motors first built an electric sports car, the Tesla Roadster in 2008, with sales of about 2,500 vehicles to 31 countries.

Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan on June 22, 2012. It unveiled its third product, the Model X, aimed at the SUV/minivan market, on February 9, 2012; however, the Model X launch was delayed until September 2015.[96][97][98] In addition to its own cars, Tesla sells electric powertrain systems to Daimler for the Smart EV, Mercedes B-Class Electric Drive and Mercedes A Class, and to Toyota for the RAV4 EV. Musk was able to bring in both companies as long-term investors in Tesla.[99]

Musk has favored building a sub-US$30,000 compact Tesla model and building and selling electric vehicle powertrain components so that other automakers can produce electric vehicles at affordable prices without having to develop the products in-house; this led to the Model 3 that is planned to have a base price of US$35,000.[100] Several mainstream publications have compared him with Henry Ford for his work on advanced vehicle powertrains.[101]

In a May 2013 interview with All Things Digital, Musk said that to overcome the range limitations of electric cars, Tesla is expanding its network of supercharger stations, tripling the number on the East and West coasts of the U.S. that June, with plans for more expansion across North America, including Canada, throughout the year.[102] As of January 29, 2016, Musk owns about 28.9 million Tesla shares, which equates to about 22% of the company.[103][104]

As of 2014, Musk's annual salary is one dollar, similar to that of Steve Jobs and other CEOs; the remainder of his compensation is in the form of stock and performance-based bonuses.[105][106]

In 2014, Musk announced that Tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up development of electric cars. "The unfortunate reality is electric car programs (or programs for any vehicle that doesn't burn hydrocarbons) at the major manufacturers are small to non-existent, constituting an average of far less than 1% of their total vehicle sales," Musk said.[107]

In February 2016, Musk announced that he had acquired the Tesla.com domain name from Stu Grossman, who had owned it since 1992, and changed Tesla's homepage to that domain.[108]

In January 2018, Musk was granted an option to buy up to 20.3 million shares if Tesla's market value were to rise to $650 billion. Majority shareholder approval was pending As of 5 March 2018.[109] The grant was also meant to end speculation about Musk's potential departure from Tesla to devote more time to his other business ventures.[110] A report by advisory firm Glass Lewis & Co. to its clients argued against granting the options.[109][needs update]
</p>
<p>
The New York Post described the pending stock option grant as an "astronomical deal" in pay when it reported that Tesla accepted $750 million in public funds from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo as part of the Buffalo Billion project, a plan to invest money to help the economy of the Buffalo, New York area. The money was used to build a factory and infrastructure for solar panel maker SolarCity, which Tesla acquired. As of March 2018, the plant employed "just a few hundred workers and its future remains uncertain." (The Buffalo area actually lost nearly 5,000 jobs between December 2016 and December 2017).[111]

In September 2018, Musk was charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a tweet claiming that funding had been secured for taking Tesla private. The lawsuit characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO on publicly traded companies.[112][113] Two days later, Musk reached a settlement with the SEC. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down as Tesla chairman within 45 days while remaining Tesla's CEO.[114] Musk also proclaimed in several interviews since that he does not regret sending the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation. According to Reuters, Musk said the tweet that cost him and the company $20 million in fines was "Worth It".[115] Musk also went on to tweet on October 1, 2018 a link to "O.P.P." by Naughty by Nature as a take on what had happened between him and the SEC.

According to ABC News, "As recently as Oct. 4 2018, Musk issued a sarcastic tweet, describing the agency [SEC] as the “Shortseller Enrichment Commission,” despite having agreed to settlement terms a week earlier that his company, Tesla, would monitor his tweets and other communications."[116]
</p>
<p>
In a December 2018 interview with CBS’s “60 Minutes”, Musk mentioned that since reaching an agreement with SEC, none of his tweets have been censored. He further mentioned that he has no respect for the SEC by saying, "I want to be clear. I do not respect the SEC."[117]

Following Musk's resignation as chairman, Tesla named Robyn Denholm to replace Elon Musk as the acting chairman. This decision came after weeks of speculation on whether Tesla would nominate James Murdoch.[118]

In January 2019, Musk traveled to China for the groundbreaking of Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory, which is the company's first large-scale plant outside the U.S.[119] Part of his visit to China, Musk also met the Chinese premier Li Keqiang. During their exchange, Musk confessed his love for China and wished he could visit China more often, to which the Chinese premier was quoted as saying "We can issue you a Chinese green card if that helps."[120]

On 19th February 2019, according to Forbes, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a million cars in 2019. Dane Butswinkas, who arrived on 17th December to serve as Tesla’s General Counsel reporting to Musk and likely reviewing his tweets after the settlement agreement was reached, resigned on 21st February.[121]
</p>
<p>
The SEC reacted to Musk’s tweet by filing in court, holding him in contempt for violating the terms of settlement agreement with such a tweet. On 26th February 2019, as mentioned in Bloomberg, Musk sarcastically addressed SEC in another tweet saying, “SEC forgot to read Tesla earnings transcript, which clearly states 350k to 500k. How embarrassing…”[122][123]</p>
